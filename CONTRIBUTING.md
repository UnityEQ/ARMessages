# Contributing

If you want to contribute:

1. Ensure that existing [pull requests](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-unity-sdk/pulls) and [issues](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-unity-sdk/issues) don’t already cover your contribution or question.
2. Please see [readme](README.md) and `ignored `(not yet implemented) tests for contribution ideas.
3. Pull requests are gladly accepted. Tag @david-rhodes to request a review.
4. Please adhere to our [coding style](CODING-STYLE.md).
5. TDD, please. Some of the problems we are facing here are very difficult to solve and one small change can quickly break everything. TDD leads to shorter iteration times and a safety net if refactors are needed. That said, use your best judgement and test "on the ground" regularly.
